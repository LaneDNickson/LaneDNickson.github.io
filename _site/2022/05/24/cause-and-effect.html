    <h2>Cause and Effect and the Causes and Effects of the Cause and Effect (and so on) </h2>
<p> 24 May 2022 - OldNewTimer </p>

<p>I’m sitting in a room. I’m sitting in a room because I need to think.<br />
It’s a thinking room. It’s a thinking room because it helps me think. It helps me think by being empty.<br />
It’s empty because I hate distractions. I hate distractions because they stop me from thinking.</p>

<p>When I stop thinking, I get off task.<br />
When I get off task, nothing gets done.<br />
When nothing gets done, I am not done.</p>

<p>(and so on)</p>

<p>Then I get up and I pace around the room. I pace around the room because it helps me think.<br />
The circles I walk mirror those in my mind. The electrical impulses make their circuits through the neurons in my head.</p>

<p>The neurons need electricity because that’s the way it is.<br />
I need to walk around because that’s the way it is.<br />
Some things are just the way they are.</p>

<p>(and so on)</p>

<p>I’m talking to myself. I’m talking to myself because it helps me think.<br />
When I talk to myself, I remember more.<br />
When I remember more, I have better ideas.</p>

<p>The more ideas I have, the better chance the thinking can end.<br />
The thinking can end when the problem is solved.<br />
This time, the problem is that there is no problem.</p>

<p>I am confused.</p>

<p>(and so on?)</p>
