        <p><img src="/assets/images/Escape.gif" alt="Escape the Buoy Demo" /></p>

<p>In this game, you have to escape a buoy with the resources at your disposal. Although it is somewhat short, it does test your critical thinking skills in a precarious situation. This project was made for Cemetech Contest 20: Transit Time in the water category. Escape, and Enjoy!</p>

<p>On a strange holiday in a strange place (somebody else’s kitchen), you are a fridge attempting to catch all of the pillows you can. If you lose more pillows than you gain, you melt. Try to get as many pillows stuffed inside of you as possible!</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/images/Headlights.gif" alt="Headlights Demo" /></p>

<p>This game is based off of the game “donkey.bas”, originally created by Microsoft’s founders Bill Gates and Neil Konzen. It was written in the ICE programming language. In this game, you have to maneuver your car as to not hit the deer in the road (or shall I say “deer in the headlights”). This project was made for Cemetech Contest 20: Transit Time in the land category. Remember to practice safe driving and pay attention while you’re on the road!</p>

<p>Originally made for MS-DOS, this one-of-a-kind game is now available on the Ti84+CE using the ICE programming language! Traveling to Oregon isn’t easy! Try your luck and use your resources to make it all the way through treacherous weather, crooks, diseases, and other hindrances in your way! If you at first don’t succeed, don’t quit. Try again! I hope you enjoy this game, I had a really fun time making it!</p>

<p>This game is a basic “shoot em’ up” game, involving planes and missiles making things go boom. It gets increasingly difficult as you complete levels. This game was made for Cemetech Contest 20 in the air category.</p>
