        <p>I’m sitting in a room. I’m sitting in a room because I need to think.<br />
It’s a thinking room. It’s a thinking room because it helps me think. It helps me think by being empty.<br />
It’s empty because I hate distractions. I hate distractions because they stop me from thinking.</p>

        <p>Well, there was that one time that, in an email to his department head, he ensured her that if she needed any thong, he was the guy to get it.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2022/03/02/the-valley.html">The Valley</a></h3>
        <p>The valley, wedged in between two nearby peaks, was quiet. The orange ball had rolled across the sky, leaving now only streaks of yellow and crimson. Night would be upon the valley soon as the last remnants of heat followed their downward channel.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2021/12/14/filet-mignon-of-the-sky.html">Filet Mignon of the Sky</a></h3>
        <p>They’re so peaceful now - the birds. Flapping from tree to tree, without a care in the world. They sing songs, collect tidbits for their nests, and love it all. At night, they are afraid, but together they stay and together they will be in the morning. On one of these mornings, a dove lands near me, eyeing a puddle; it’s the last sigh of yesterday’s sickly storm. The dove glances in my direction as one of its eyes meets mine. It cocks its head to the left, and then to the right. It is clearly amused by this huge figure that is staring at it. Maybe the birds write about watching people too. I don’t know, their wings may be poetry that we can never understand the simplistic beauty of. Anyways, I lift my pen from the paper I’m rambling on and begin to draw on another.</p>

behind a Venus moon,</p>

        <p>And there was that one time, a cold, somber winter, that I lay in bed. There’s a little routine I have - when I become a submarine. That night, it went something like this:</p>

        <h3><a href="/2021/05/25/four-men-stand.html">Four Men Stand</a></h3>
        <p>Four men stand in the forest. Surrounded in darkness, they watch the ground. Smoke is rising everywhere; a fallen torch has set a stump afire.</p>

For his duty to scribe was no more behest</p>

        <h3><a href="/2020/04/11/the-note.html">The Note</a></h3>
        <p>There’s a note on the wall<br />
I am confused as to how it got there<br />
An innocent scotch-taped communique</p>

        <p>The English language constricts me<br />
It has trapped me in its nest<br />
With all its nouns and verb-ery<br />
It’s really all a mess</p>

passing time by think or draw.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2020/03/21/OW.html">Ow!</a></h3>
        <p>I saw it on the land so green,<br />
In the Autumn air,<br />
The Spurs and Soles were on the scene,<br />
It was a war - waged thus fair.</p>

        <h3><a href="/2020/03/15/VEND.html">VEND</a></h3>
        <p>I take a breath and my insides numb,<br />
The figure approaches - staring blankly.<br />
Will it choose the lofty sum?<br />
Something I enjoy quite frankly.</p>

        <p>Oh Dolphin!<br />
I see you there,<br />
peeking - underneath the briny bumble.<br />
You wade and wait for my patience to crumble.<br />
but, as you can see, it is no affair.</p>
