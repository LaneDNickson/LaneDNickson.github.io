    <h2> TI-84 Plus CE Development </h2>

<p>I challenged myself to create software for a development platform I was unfamiliar with. I chose a graphing calculator I owned, the TI-84 Plus CE. With its capability to run eZ80 Assembly with C support, I was able to learn fundamental software principles such as working with pointers, memory management, and developing software without the use of robust libraries.</p>
