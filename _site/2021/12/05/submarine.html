  <p>And there was that one time, a cold, somber winter, that I lay in bed. There’s a little routine I have - when I become a submarine. That night, it went something like this:</p>

<p>“Seal the hatch and prepare for submersion!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, right away sir, with haste and pride, sir. Sir, we’re on our way, sir”.</p>

<p>“That’s enough private, all for now”.</p>

<p>The submarine sprawls quietly on the ocean floor, a bed of seaweed to buffer from the coils of coral. In his quarters the captain is awakened.</p>

<p>“Sir, our pressure levels are unsustainable at this depth”.</p>

<p>“Then bring us up private!”, says groggy eyes.</p>

<p>Private Wires is a bit like a penny. He’s as tranquil and honest as Abe sometimes, but he can immediately flip and become frightened and excessively meticulous, caged up in a prison of marble pillars. Either way, he doesn’t think his words come across as helpful unless he utters a whole earful of them.</p>

<p>We reach shallower waters and all is well, but not a useful one at that. I can almost hear the fan of seagulls gently toss the vessels of the vessel; drifting yet again from ebb to flow and head to toe.</p>

<p>“Sir, Sir!” Wires needs to add his two cents.</p>

<p>“What is it, private?”, says red eyes.</p>

<p>“We’re at too shallow a depth, they may spot us!”</p>

<p>“God dammit Wires! Send us down again but don’t burn us up this time.”</p>

<p>“Yessir.”</p>

<p>The submarine, like a sea turtle, drifts on the currents as the crew slumbers in their shell of steel and algae. All is well again; we are prepared for the coming storm.</p>
