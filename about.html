<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm Lane, a computer science major at North Carolina State University. I'll be posting my personal projects on this site. </p>

<p>As you can see, most of the software here is made for the TI-84 Plus CE, a color graphing calculator made by Texas Instruments. With its low-level hardware and long history, it is the perfect device to learn programming basics on. This has been a hobby for years, but my focus has mostly shifted to the main platforms for developers. </p>

<p>Currently, I am focusing on coursework (mostly Java, C, Python, etc.), but still work on the occasional hobby project (Like this website!). I also do other random stuff in my blog and socials. Feel free to check back on the pages here for
    future updates on projects!</p>
