title: Wordle in C
---
During the 2022 Spring semester, I recreated The New York Times' "Wordle" game in C . Instead of a web-based application, it was a C program designed to run in the terminal.

Due to university academic integrity regulations, I cannot publically post my code for this project. If you are an employer interested in viewing my work, please send a private message my direction.
