title: Personal Website
---
In the spirit of learning web development, I have created this website to act as my personal portfolio. It started as a simple Google site, but was eventually built from scratch using GitHub Pages. In its current state, this site is generated using the Jekyll static-site building framework, with custom HTML and CSS.
