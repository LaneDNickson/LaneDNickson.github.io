<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm Lane, a computer science major at North Carolina State University. I'll be posting my personal projects on
    this site. </p>

<p> Ever since a young age, I have been fascinated by the function and purpose of computers in society, and am
    determined to
    learn as much as I can about them. I am currently exploring software development as a career choice through
    university projects and programs.</p>

<p>Currently, I am focusing on coursework (mostly Java, C, Python, etc.), but still work on the occasional hobby project
    (like this website!). I also do other random stuff in my blog and socials. Feel free to check back on the pages here
    for
    future updates on projects!</p>
