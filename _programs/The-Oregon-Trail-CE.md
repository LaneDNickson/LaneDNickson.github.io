Originally made for MS-DOS, this one-of-a-kind game is now available on the Ti84+CE using the ICE programming language! Traveling to Oregon isn't easy! Try your luck and use your resources to make it all the way through treacherous weather, crooks, diseases, and other hindrances in your way! If you at first don't succeed, don't quit. Try again! I hope you enjoy this game, I had a really fun time making it!
