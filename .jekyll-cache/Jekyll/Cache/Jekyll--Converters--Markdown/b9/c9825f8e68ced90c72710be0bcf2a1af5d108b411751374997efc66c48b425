I"P<p>I like the rain.</p>

<p>Walking down path I go; sparkling shards of diamonds fall from above.</p>

<p>I trudge on, and they begin to stick to my shoes.</p>

<p>The wind blows, casting another wave.</p>

<p>I am glitter.</p>

<p>And then I step inside, and realize that I am soaking wet.</p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>But I like the rain.</p>
