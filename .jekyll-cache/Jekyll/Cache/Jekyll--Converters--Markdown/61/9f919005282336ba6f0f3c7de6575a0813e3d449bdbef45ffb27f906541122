I"Þ<p>The English language constricts me<br />
It has trapped me in its nest<br />
With all its nouns and verb-ery<br />
Itâ€™s really all a mess</p>

<p>Letters slither off its tongue<br />
It suffocates my thoughts<br />
And then just when Iâ€™ve had my fun<br />
It bites and my mind rots</p>

<p>The poison spreads throughout my veins<br />
My capillaries dim<br />
Speech is numbing from the pain<br />
Words taught not to swim</p>

<p>But then my mind takes rules apart<br />
And fights the sadist still<br />
Stakes of meaning through the heart<br />
Until its final trill</p>

<p>Now here I sit upon the words<br />
A stack of some once-idle snips<br />
I rearrange them, now unheard<br />
Into a structured, broadened bliss</p>
