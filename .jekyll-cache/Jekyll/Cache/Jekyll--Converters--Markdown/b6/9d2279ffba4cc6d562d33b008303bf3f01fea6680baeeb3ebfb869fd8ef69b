I"ò<p>There was a world<br />
not far from here<br />
behind a Venus moon,</p>

<p>where people all<br />
with life, in awe<br />
played a different tune.</p>

<p>This world lost<br />
called Infantas<br />
was developed to the T.</p>

<p>Peace did blare<br />
rang in the air<br />
throughout society.</p>

<p>Now this old place<br />
unlike our space<br />
time could not be wrought.</p>

<p>As a ship to wave<br />
and captain slain<br />
back to port it brought.</p>

<p>Old men gave<br />
to childâ€™s play<br />
and crawled into the womb.</p>

<p>Loved and dear<br />
from every year<br />
emerged from greying tomb.</p>

<p>Soldiers rose<br />
with ironed clothes<br />
to greet their families.</p>

<p>Gifts were back<br />
and then rewrapped<br />
under Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Out of ash<br />
nations clashed<br />
and back to dust they went.</p>

<p>A farmerâ€™s child<br />
in weather mild<br />
came back from yearsâ€™ lament.</p>

<p>More trees grew<br />
with greener hue<br />
as span of people dwindled.</p>

<p>Sticks and twigs<br />
made lovely jigs<br />
as gatherers found their kindle.</p>

<p>Soon the land<br />
no grain, just sand<br />
lost all its humanity.</p>

<p>And this place lost<br />
called Infantas<br />
faded without memory.</p>
