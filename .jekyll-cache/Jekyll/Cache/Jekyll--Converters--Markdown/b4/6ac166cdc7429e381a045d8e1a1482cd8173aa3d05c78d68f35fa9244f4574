I"§<p>As ash to ash and dust to dust,<br />
Traversing through a stolid land</p>

<p>Approaching us, it billows;<br />
Neglecting to stoop, instead to rise</p>

<p>My vision is clouded by the static it brings.<br />
I cannot see you. You cannot see me.</p>

<p>Our connection remains, but the chain;<br />
It rusts.</p>

<p>The foundry from which it was forged is cold and bare.<br />
The bond weakens from wear and neglect.</p>

<p>But I grab the chain - pulling tight;<br />
Clinging to the last fiber - the final chance.</p>

<p>Snap!</p>

<p>The link has departed - from one to two</p>

<p>The whirlwind winds with dust and ash<br />
Spinning thoughts in a tumult of gray</p>

<p>It throws me out, thrashing and swinging<br />
Spitting a smirk as it leaves.</p>

<p>Facing a long and desolate path<br />
No end, yet I must keep moving</p>

<p>Walking<br />
Trudging<br />
Pacing<br />
Grudging<br />
Racing<br />
Sprinting</p>

<p>Huffing<br />
Slowing<br />
Puffing<br />
Stopping<br />
And dropping to my knees</p>

<p>When I see in the distance, a gleam<br />
A blip on the horizon</p>

<p>Standing there, bringing newfound hope<br />
I make for the crest of the hill</p>

<p>And find nothing but another desolate path</p>

<p>To another blip on the horizon<br />
To mountains, rivers<br />
To days of gales and droughts<br />
To more hope.</p>

<p>Through all the noise, pain, worry, and sorrow<br />
Finding the real path <br />
To you.</p>
