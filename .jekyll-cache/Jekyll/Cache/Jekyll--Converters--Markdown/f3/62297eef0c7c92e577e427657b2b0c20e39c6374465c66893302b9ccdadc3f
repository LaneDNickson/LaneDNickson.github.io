I" <p>I sit to stare<br />
at the wall<br />
my thumbs a twiddling snare<br />
passing time by think or draw.</p>

<p>Will it come to time again?<br />
My patience wearing very thin<br />
overdue with spite I can<br />
should I leave to lose the win?</p>

<p>About to stand but then I think<br />
poem and prose to serve<br />
quenching my mind with a drink<br />
As writing to hors dâ€™oeuvre.</p>

<p>Alas!</p>

<p>It arrives to me<br />
the message of a mess<br />
come again like tide of sea<br />
tomorrow shall bring questioned success.</p>
