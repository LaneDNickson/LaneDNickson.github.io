I"›<p>There‚Äôs a note on the wall<br />
I am confused as to how it got there<br />
An innocent scotch-taped communique</p>

<p>But the mystery of it kills me<br />
The debate on whether to let it be or break the seal within</p>

<p>A note on the wall‚Ä¶</p>

<p>What shadow I think<br />
of newfound knowledge<br />
or tacit worry<br />
a threshold into another life</p>

<p>But here I stand upon the edge<br />
unmovingly</p>

<p>‚ÄúI should be brave‚Äù sowed deep in my mind<br />
A battle fought with water, salt, and grime<br />
Trying to understand these feelings - and failing</p>

<p>But then I stop, and actually think.</p>

<p>What is there to lose?</p>

<p>A note on the wall‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Is it really there to end it all?</p>
