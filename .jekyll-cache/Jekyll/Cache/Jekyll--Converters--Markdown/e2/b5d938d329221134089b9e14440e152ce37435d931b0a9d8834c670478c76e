I"§<p>Originally made for MS-DOS, this one-of-a-kind game is now available on the Ti84+CE using the ICE programming language! Traveling to Oregon isnâ€™t easy! Try your luck and use your resources to make it all the way through treacherous weather, crooks, diseases, and other hindrances in your way! If you at first donâ€™t succeed, donâ€™t quit. Try again! I hope you enjoy this game, I had a really fun time making it!</p>
