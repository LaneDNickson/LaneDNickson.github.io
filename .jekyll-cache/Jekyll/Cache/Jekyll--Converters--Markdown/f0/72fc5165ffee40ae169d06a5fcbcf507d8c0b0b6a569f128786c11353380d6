I"ø<p>I saw it on the land so green,<br />
In the Autumn air,<br />
The Spurs and Soles were on the scene,<br />
It was a war - waged thus fair.</p>

<p>The Spurs, ones of common folk,<br />
Were fighting for their land,<br />
Bastioned it as shell to yolk,<br />
A fine and mighty plan.</p>

<p>The Soles, on the other hand,<br />
Were looking for a home.<br />
Treading for a world to withstand,<br />
Their weighty steps unknown.</p>

<p>On the verdant battlefield,<br />
The traps of Spurs were laid.<br />
But the Solesâ€™ protections did yield<br />
To the Spursâ€™ dismay.</p>

<p>Many, many years did sink<br />
The bleak-brown dirt was all that left<br />
War had torn the land - and just to think<br />
The Spurs and Soles could have lived and let.</p>
