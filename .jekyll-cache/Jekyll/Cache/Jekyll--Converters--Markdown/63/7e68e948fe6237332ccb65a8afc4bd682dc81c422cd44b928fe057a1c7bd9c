I"û<p>Oh Dolphin!<br />
I see you there,<br />
peeking - underneath the briny bumble.<br />
You wade and wait for my patience to crumble.<br />
but, as you can see, it is no affair.</p>

<p>Oh Dolphin!<br />
I see your fin,<br />
waving - offering a greeting grimace.<br />
I paddle over with an open premise.<br />
A friendship I may or might win.</p>

<p>Oh Dolphin!<br />
You see me here from not-afar,<br />
an outstretched hand - hoping for a pet.<br />
But man and mammal are not there yet.<br />
The situation has gone ajar.</p>

<p>Oh Dolphin!<br />
You give a nudge,<br />
a tiny push - a sudden lash,<br />
makes my dinghy flip and splash.<br />
This jest you make is not yet to budge.</p>

<p>Oh Dolphinâ€¦</p>

<p>Your jest is just the thing I love.</p>
