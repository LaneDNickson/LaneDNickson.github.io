I"x<p>With the flourish of the pen, he lay to rest<br />
For his duty to scribe was no more behest</p>

<p>The man’s hands ached and his eyes were dry<br />
However, the creativity within him still thrived</p>

<p>He thought of worlds to once behold<br />
He dreamt of stories soon to be told</p>

<p>Yet when many times he desired to write<br />
The pen’s will was much more than his might</p>

<p>Wrestled he did with the quill for days<br />
Until hopeless on his bed he stayed</p>

<p>Worlds rotted to the core<br />
Stories unspoken were pondered no more</p>

<p>The man fell into a void of forgetful bliss<br />
Those of his own creation he did not miss</p>

<p>His soul was lost in the modern day<br />
for the thoughts in his head lay sealed away</p>

<p>From this man’s story, I urge you now<br />
Take a breath, wipe your brow</p>

<p>Write what you want, and take a bow</p>
