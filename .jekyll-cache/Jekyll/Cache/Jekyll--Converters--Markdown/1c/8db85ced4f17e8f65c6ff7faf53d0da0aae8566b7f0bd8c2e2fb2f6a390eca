I"Õ<p>This game is based off of the game â€œdonkey.basâ€, originally created by Microsoftâ€™s founders Bill Gates and Neil Konzen. It was written in the ICE programming language. In this game, you have to maneuver your car as to not hit the deer in the road (or shall I say â€œdeer in the headlightsâ€). This project was made for Cemetech Contest 20: Transit Time in the land category. Remember to practice safe driving and pay attention while youâ€™re on the road!</p>
