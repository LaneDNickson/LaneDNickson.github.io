I"é<p>I take a breath and my insides numb,<br />
The figure approaches - staring blankly.<br />
Will it choose the lofty sum?<br />
Something I enjoy quite frankly.</p>

<p>A hand darts towards my soul,<br />
My frigid display is keen.<br />
It shows what I offer to the scene,<br />
The weighty promise of ice-cold.</p>

<p>But alas, I lie,<br />
For the promise I have made is hollow,<br />
No refreshing remedy you wish to swallow,<br />
A palate that is left to dry.</p>

<p>SOLD OUT</p>
