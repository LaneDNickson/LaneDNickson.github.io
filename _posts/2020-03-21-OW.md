I saw it on the land so green,
In the Autumn air,
The Spurs and Soles were on the scene,
It was a war - waged thus fair.

The Spurs, ones of common folk,
Were fighting for their land,
Bastioned it as shell to yolk,
A fine and mighty plan.

The Soles, on the other hand,
Were looking for a home.
Treading for a world to withstand,
Their weighty steps unknown.

On the verdant battlefield,
The traps of Spurs were laid.
But the Soles’ protections did yield
To the Spurs’ dismay.

Many, many years did sink
The bleak-brown dirt was all that left
War had torn the land - and just to think
The Spurs and Soles could have lived and let.
