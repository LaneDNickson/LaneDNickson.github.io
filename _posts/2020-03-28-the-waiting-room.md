I sit to stare
at the wall
my thumbs a twiddling snare
passing time by think or draw.

Will it come to time again?
My patience wearing very thin
overdue with spite I can
should I leave to lose the win?

About to stand but then I think
poem and prose to serve
quenching my mind with a drink
As writing to hors d'oeuvre.

Alas!

It arrives to me
the message of a mess
come again like tide of sea
tomorrow shall bring questioned success.
