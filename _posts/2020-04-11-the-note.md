There's a note on the wall
I am confused as to how it got there
An innocent scotch-taped communique

But the mystery of it kills me
The debate on whether to let it be or break the seal within

A note on the wall...

What shadow I think
of newfound knowledge
or tacit worry
a threshold into another life

But here I stand upon the edge
unmovingly

"I should be brave" sowed deep in my mind
A battle fought with water, salt, and grime
Trying to understand these feelings - and failing

But then I stop, and actually think.

What is there to lose?

A note on the wall...

Is it really there to end it all?
