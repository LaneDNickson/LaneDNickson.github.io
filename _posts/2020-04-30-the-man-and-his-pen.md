With the flourish of the pen, he lay to rest
For his duty to scribe was no more behest

The man's hands ached and his eyes were dry
However, the creativity within him still thrived 

He thought of worlds to once behold
He dreamt of stories soon to be told

Yet when many times he desired to write
The pen's will was much more than his might

Wrestled he did with the quill for days
Until hopeless on his bed he stayed

Worlds rotted to the core
Stories unspoken were pondered no more

The man fell into a void of forgetful bliss
Those of his own creation he did not miss

His soul was lost in the modern day
for the thoughts in his head lay sealed away

From this man's story, I urge you now
Take a breath, wipe your brow

Write what you want, and take a bow
