I'm learning to take an interest in the little things. The things that we do - seeds that we sow in ourselves. The little things lay dormant in us until a moment. The moment when all of that tender care and watchfulness renders the conditions just right for the seed to sprout.

When that little thing grows into a big, beautiful thing, people notice. They look at you differently, amazed, maybe even jealous of your growth. But they look, and you look, and even I look. All this vision from one little thing.

A Seed,

Lane
