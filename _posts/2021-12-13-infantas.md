There was a world
not far from here
behind a Venus moon,



where people all
with life, in awe
played a different tune.



This world lost
called Infantas
was developed to the T.



Peace did blare
rang in the air
throughout society.



Now this old place
unlike our space
time could not be wrought.



As a ship to wave
and captain slain
back to port it brought.



Old men gave
to child's play
and crawled into the womb.



Loved and dear
from every year
emerged from greying tomb.



Soldiers rose
with ironed clothes
to greet their families.



Gifts were back
and then rewrapped
under Christmas trees.



Out of ash
nations clashed
and back to dust they went.



A farmer's child
in weather mild
came back from yearsâ€™ lament.



More trees grew
with greener hue
as span of people dwindled.



Sticks and twigs
made lovely jigs
as gatherers found their kindle.



Soon the land
no grain, just sand
lost all its humanity.



And this place lost
called Infantas
faded without memory.
