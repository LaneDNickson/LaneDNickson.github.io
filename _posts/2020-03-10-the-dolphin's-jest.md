Oh Dolphin!
I see you there,
peeking - underneath the briny bumble.
You wade and wait for my patience to crumble.
but, as you can see, it is no affair.

Oh Dolphin!
I see your fin,
waving - offering a greeting grimace.
I paddle over with an open premise.
A friendship I may or might win.

Oh Dolphin!
You see me here from not-afar,
an outstretched hand - hoping for a pet.
But man and mammal are not there yet.
The situation has gone ajar.

Oh Dolphin!
You give a nudge,
a tiny push - a sudden lash,
makes my dinghy flip and splash.
This jest you make is not yet to budge.

Oh Dolphinâ€¦

Your jest is just the thing I love.
