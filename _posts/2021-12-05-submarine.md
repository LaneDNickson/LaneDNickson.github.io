And there was that one time, a cold, somber winter, that I lay in bed. There's a little routine I have - when I become a submarine. That night, it went something like this:

"Seal the hatch and prepare for submersion!"

"Yes, sir, right away sir, with haste and pride, sir. Sir, we're on our way, sir".

"That's enough private, all for now". 

The submarine sprawls quietly on the ocean floor, a bed of seaweed to buffer from the coils of coral. In his quarters the captain is awakened.

"Sir, our pressure levels are unsustainable at this depth".

"Then bring us up private!", says groggy eyes.

Private Wires is a bit like a penny. He's as tranquil and honest as Abe sometimes, but he can immediately flip and become frightened and excessively meticulous, caged up in a prison of marble pillars. Either way, he doesn't think his words come across as helpful unless he utters a whole earful of them.

We reach shallower waters and all is well, but not a useful one at that. I can almost hear the fan of seagulls gently toss the vessels of the vessel; drifting yet again from ebb to flow and head to toe.

"Sir, Sir!" Wires needs to add his two cents.

"What is it, private?", says red eyes.

"We're at too shallow a depth, they may spot us!"

"God dammit Wires! Send us down again but don't burn us up this time."

"Yessir."

The submarine, like a sea turtle, drifts on the currents as the crew slumbers in their shell of steel and algae. All is well again; we are prepared for the coming storm.
