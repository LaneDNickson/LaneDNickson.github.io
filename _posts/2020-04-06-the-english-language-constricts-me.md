The English language constricts me
It has trapped me in its nest
With all its nouns and verb-ery
It’s really all a mess

Letters slither off its tongue
It suffocates my thoughts
And then just when I’ve had my fun
It bites and my mind rots

The poison spreads throughout my veins
My capillaries dim
Speech is numbing from the pain
Words taught not to swim

But then my mind takes rules apart
And fights the sadist still
Stakes of meaning through the heart
Until its final trill

Now here I sit upon the words
A stack of some once-idle snips
I rearrange them, now unheard
Into a structured, broadened bliss
