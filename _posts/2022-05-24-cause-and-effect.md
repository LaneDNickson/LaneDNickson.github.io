I'm sitting in a room. I'm sitting in a room because I need to think.
It's a thinking room. It's a thinking room because it helps me think. It helps me think by being empty.
It's empty because I hate distractions. I hate distractions because they stop me from thinking.



When I stop thinking, I get off task.
When I get off task, nothing gets done.
When nothing gets done, I am not done.



(and so on)



Then I get up and I pace around the room. I pace around the room because it helps me think.
The circles I walk mirror those in my mind. The electrical impulses make their circuits through the neurons in my head. 



The neurons need electricity because that's the way it is.
I need to walk around because that's the way it is.
Some things are just the way they are.



(and so on)



I'm talking to myself. I'm talking to myself because it helps me think.
When I talk to myself, I remember more.
When I remember more, I have better ideas.



The more ideas I have, the better chance the thinking can end.
The thinking can end when the problem is solved.
This time, the problem is that there is no problem.



I am confused.



(and so on?)
