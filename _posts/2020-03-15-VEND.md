I take a breath and my insides numb,
The figure approaches - staring blankly.
Will it choose the lofty sum?
Something I enjoy quite frankly.

A hand darts towards my soul,
My frigid display is keen.
It shows what I offer to the scene,
The weighty promise of ice-cold.

But alas, I lie,
For the promise I have made is hollow,
No refreshing remedy you wish to swallow,
A palate that is left to dry.

SOLD OUT
