As ash to ash and dust to dust,
Traversing through a stolid land

Approaching us, it billows;
Neglecting to stoop, instead to rise

My vision is clouded by the static it brings.
I cannot see you. You cannot see me.

Our connection remains, but the chain;
It rusts.

The foundry from which it was forged is cold and bare.
The bond weakens from wear and neglect.

But I grab the chain - pulling tight;
Clinging to the last fiber - the final chance.

Snap!

The link has departed - from one to two

The whirlwind winds with dust and ash
Spinning thoughts in a tumult of gray

It throws me out, thrashing and swinging
Spitting a smirk as it leaves.

Facing a long and desolate path
No end, yet I must keep moving

Walking
Trudging
Pacing
Grudging
Racing
Sprinting

Huffing
Slowing
Puffing
Stopping
And dropping to my knees

When I see in the distance, a gleam
A blip on the horizon

Standing there, bringing newfound hope
I make for the crest of the hill

And find nothing but another desolate path

To another blip on the horizon
To mountains, rivers
To days of gales and droughts
To more hope.

Through all the noise, pain, worry, and sorrow
Finding the real path 
To you.
