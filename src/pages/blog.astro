      Hello! I'm Lane, a computer science major at North Carolina State
      University. I'll be posting my personal projects on this site. Ever since
      a young age, I have been fascinated by the function and purpose of
      computers in society, and am determined to learn as much as I can about
      them. I am currently exploring software development as a career choice
      through university projects and programs. Currently, I am focusing on
      coursework (mostly Java, C, Python, etc.), but still work on the
      occasional hobby project (like this website!). I also do other random
      stuff in my blog and socials. Feel free to check back on the pages here
      for future updates on projects!
